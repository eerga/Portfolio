# Python Projects
## [Project 1: The popularity secret behind Pokémon card resale market](https://github.com/eerga/da_project)

### Goal
Our Data Analytics team assessed the influence of Pokémon YouTubers on Pokémon card resale. Our **hypothesis** was: the higher the YouYube views are, the higher the resale rate of Pokémon cards is. We web scraped historical data of Pokémon card prices and top 10 Pokémon YouTubers’ views, using Wayback Machine and Python </br>

### What we used
The packages we used are *Chromedrive* and *BeautifulSoup*.

### Project Conclusion
After conductig statistical analysis and building a descriptive model, we concluded that YouTube views solely cannot explain an increased popularity in Pokémon card resale and other features should be incorporated into the study.

The two main metrics used to derive the conclusion were p-value and R^2 score as demonstrated in the picture below
